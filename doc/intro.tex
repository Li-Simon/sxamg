\section{Overview}

\verb|SXAMG| is an AMG (Algebraic Multi-Grid) solver 
library for sparse linear system, \verb|Ax = b|. 
The package is designed for Linux, Unix and Mac systems. 
It is also possible to compile under Windows if \verb|USE_UNIX| is set to 0. 
The code is written by C, and it is serial.

The initial code is from FASP solver, http://fasp.sourceforge.net, which implements a collection of Krylov solvers, AMG solvers and preconditioners.

The purpose of this refactorization is to provide a standalone AMG solver to support other numerical applications and to validate new ideas in the future. The \verb|SXAMG| can serve as a solver and a preconditioning method.
\verb|SXAMG| rewrites all the data structures, subroutines, and file structures, and it removes many components of the original implementation and third-party package dependency.
